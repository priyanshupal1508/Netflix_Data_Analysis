# Netflix_Data_Analysis
This project is a simple and beginner-friendly Python analysis of a Netflix movie dataset.
The goal is to explore the dataset, clean it, and find interesting insights about movie genres, popularity, votes, and yearly release trends.
The project shows how to use Python, Pandas, and basic data analysis techniques in a practical way.

#ABOUT THE PROJECT:

This is a personal learning and practice project created to improve my Python and data analysis skills.
It focuses on simple, readable code and clear insights rather than complex machine learning models.
Anyone who wants to learn basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) can use this project as a reference.
